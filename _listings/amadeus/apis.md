  description: "Amadeus has partnered with YapQ to bring you point of interest APIs
    with the goal of offering you unbiased ratings of landmarks and tourist attractions.
    YapQ rates these points according to their interest on social media and provides
    Wikipedia content and Geonames ID in a given city. \nYapQ's service indexes millions
    of points around the world, and provides content in 12 different languages. This
    allows you to ensure you catch the must-see sights in a YapQ supported city.\nEach
    point of interest comes with links to content, grading information, location and
    directions to help make discovering your destination easy and fun.\nThis service
    is still under active development, and the response format may change without
    warning. We'd be interested in your feedback - send us an email."
