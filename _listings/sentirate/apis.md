  those questions for a billion links and counting. Our patented technology analyzes
  content from over sixty social sites, news sources, homepages and blog platforms
  and identifies the actual people behind it, combining their scattered digital footprints
  into a comprehensive record of their online identity.Google calculates the likelihood
  of any link being associated to a keyword. PeekYou calculates the likelihood of
  any link being associated to an individual.The company was founded in 2006 by Michael
