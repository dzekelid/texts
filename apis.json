You can cache and save Polly&rsquo;s speech audio to replay offline or redistribute. And Polly is easy to use. You simply send the text you want converted into speech to the Polly API, and Polly immediately returns the audio stream to your application so your application can play it directly or store it in a standard audio file format, such as MP3.With Polly, you only pay for the number of characters you convert to speech, and you can save and replay Polly&rsquo;s generated speech. Polly&rsquo;s low cost per character converted, and lack of restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way to enable Text-to-Speech everywhere.",
